## Overview
This repository contains my personal solutions and source code for the lab assignments of the **Microprocessors Laboratory** course, taught in the 7th semester at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).

The course focuses on the architecture, programming, and interfacing of microprocessors and microcontrollers (AVR ATmega328pb). The exercises range from basic I/O operations in Assembly to complex embedded systems programming in C, utilizing timers, interrupts, and serial communication.
